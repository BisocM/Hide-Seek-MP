description = A multiplayer hide & seek game mode for Teardown with a sleek appearance.

Please be aware that the mod may still have some bugs, as it was developed in under a day.

[h1]Features[/h1]
The game mode is fairly feature-complete, and was made in a rapid prototyping fashion. I have added some of the features that I consider to be important for a good-will hide & seek play with friends.

Features include:
- Various admin controls to fine-tune the game mode
- Mini-abilities for hiders like a dash & a super-jump to grant the edge over seekers. These are toggleable by the host
- A tagging & kill-to-find system for the seekers, togglable by host
- Infection mode
- Spectators
- Localization with current support for EN, RU
and so on.

I have explicitly opted not to implement any weapons-control interfaces, as there are other mods that are capable of handling that. If a need arises, I will work on basic weapons control.
